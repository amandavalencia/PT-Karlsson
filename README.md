# React + TypeScript + Vite

Project idea summary

## I have developed a website for a personal trainer specializing in martial arts. The website enables the owner to upload training videosl. Customers can access content tailored to their skill level—beginner, intermediate, or advanced—with each level offering various techniques. This platform provides a flexible training experience for martial arts enthusiasts at all levels.

Purpose
The idea for the website stems from the fact that there aren't many personal trainers offering training programs focused specifically on martial arts that provide a clear plan for how the training should progress. The goal is to deliver a training plan that feels like working with a personal trainer, but without the high cost associated with personal training.
